# Deforestation and soybean production in Brazil

The script in this repository is dedicated to analyse the link between soybean production by the big firms in Brazil and its link to deforestation.

# Objectives

1. Identify the largest soy producing state in Brazil and its associated deforestation risk.
2. Assess the extent to which companies exporting soy from this state are exposed to deforestation.
3. Assess the possible total carbon emission caused by deforestation.
4. If I have to deal with a sustainability officer from China, which companies should I recommend him so that his company does not source soybean from unsustainable companies?

# About the dataset

The dataset contains data about the soy production of each exporting company that is present in the states of Brazil in 2017.
